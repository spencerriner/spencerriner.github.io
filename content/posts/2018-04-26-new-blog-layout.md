I made a new blog layout! I've been working on this for a few weeks now and did a massive overhaul of pretty much everything. It was kind of a gnarly process and took a super long time, but there were some good lessons learned along the way. 

I went online and found a free theme that looked like it would be easy to modify to my liking. I ended up landing on [jekyll-simple](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/jekyll-simple/). It had some pretty interesting quirks, a few typos, and lots of CSS classes that I couldn't really figure out, but otherwise it's a pretty cool theme. I went into this knowing I wanted to make a lot of changes, these are the big ones:

* Change colors from black & white to Solarized Dark
* Change font to **Spinnaker** via Google Fonts
* Change homepage to show only post titles
* Add CSS-powered striped background

Lots of cool stuff I figured out to do along the way. The CSS background in particular was a pretty cool trick. It's a lot easier to use CSS rather than tile an image, and it ended up just being a few lines. The colors are still in flux for now; I'm not 100% happy with how it all looks at this point. I do like the pink hover on links, though, that ended up being kind of a happy accident. 

At this point, I think a lot of things are subject to change, especially in terms of color; it's pretty loud right now and I will probably end up doing something more subdued later on. I also want to add a page for tags, and go back to fix up the categories for old posts. 

It's been busy lately, so I haven't had much motivation to post (it kind of feels like more work which I have plenty of right now) but I'm definitely happy with the new layout...for now.
