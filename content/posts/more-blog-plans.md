I think this is quickly becoming a *meta-blog* - a blog where I write about the layout, design, and contents of the blog itself and nothing else. I'm not sure what wire in my brain makes me obsess with the attributes of this thing instead of its content (arguably the important part) but whatever; here we are.

I have made the switch from Jekyll to Hugo. At the time of writing this, I haven't even committed in the change so I don't really know if it works with GitHub Pages or not, but I've been thinking about switching to Netlify anyway. Jekyll was really cool, and still is, but I feel like I have more power or control or whatever using Hugo. It's a lot more complex and the hierarchy of files is kind of overwhelming, but I think after I write about a hundred or so more posts then it'll be easier to make decisions. Making new posts is also a lot easier, I love the idea of archetypes and creating posts from the command line with `hugo new posts/post-name.md`, though it might take some getting used to not having the date appended to the beginning of the file name. I might try and figure out a way to do that without including the date in the actual title. 

I found a **great** theme called [Simplicity](https://github.com/eshlox/simplicity) that I've modified to my own liking, but really it didn't need much modification at all. Shouts to `eshlox` for designing an awesome theme. I added a few social icons on the homepage as well as a section for links to music I've made. I might make those social icons later on. I also changed a few colors (learned a little bit about `npm run build` along the way) and that's pretty much it. I tried another theme called **Minimo** but it ended up being a little too busy for my liking and I couldn't figure out how to change compiled CSS - I don't think the author encouraged doing that anyway.

The cool thing about new themes is they can make you rethink the content, purpose, and general skeleton of your blog. At first, I wasn't really into the idea of having links on the homepage that go to posts, categories, and tags, but now I kind of like it. It makes me think of websites I used to make when I was a kid that has those "splash" pages with just a giant picture or something, then you follow that through to the site's real content. I don't even know what those old websites were about or why they existed, I think I mostly just copied animated .gifs of Dragon Ball Z characters or copied in Pokemon urban legends. It was fun at the time.

Anyway the point I was trying to make is that I've got a few "big-bucket" ideas for posts floating in my head. I also want to write them down so I can go retrofit the posts I've already written into the right category. Tags will be a lot less structure.

## Sysadmin

This will be kind of a catchall for any Linux, system administration, technology thoughts I have. I'm anticipating this being the most populated category since it's kind of the only real justification I have for even having a blog in the first place. I recently read a blog post linked on Hacker News about how writing tutorials can improve your own understanding of a topic. It seemed like a wholesome idea and lined up with my own motivation for having a blog, but the comments mostly made it seem like a horrible idea, just because there are so many garbage quality tutorials out there and it would be irresponsible to just add to the noise. I think I'm usually pretty upfront with my level of confidence, so there shouldn't be anyone thinking I'm the authority on stuff. I'm really just trying to reflect and learn.

## Review

I love reading reviews on stuff that I'm thinking about buying, most recently raw denim. I really love [Indigoshrimp](https://indigoshrimp.wordpress.com/) - he takes really good pictures of his purchases and provides succinct thoughts on them. I have a few pieces that I'd like to photograph and write about, so at some point there will be some content in this category. Aside from denim, I'm thinking about writing about other clothing, guitars, computers, whatever. Just stuff I have and can give an honest opinion about.

## Audio

This will probably be a music/audio hybrid. Anything about instruments, Logic Pro X, audio production, amplifiers, whatever will probably be found here. 

## Project

Occasionally I'll get a productive streak and work on personal projects. Right now, my pending project is setting up a Raspberry Pi as a [pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net) as well as an OpenVPN server for when I'm out. Still trying to figure out what "road warrior" refers to when people talk about VPNs, but I'm sure I'll find out. More projects will probably follow.

## Blog

The whole thing is a blog right? I guess this is a miscellaneous category for personal ramblings and stuff. Not sure how much of that kind of thing there will be.

## Meta

This post! Anything that talks about changes to the blog, switching of providers, or whatever. 

Anyway those are the anticipated categories. For now, I'm excited! I am now going to try to figure out how best to move this entire directory into my existing git repo.
