## Apple

I like Macs. Apple has had their fair share of missteps lately, but there's no denying they make a good product. And it isn't a phone - it's an operating system. Confusingly rebranded to macOS, what I continue to call **OS X** in my head is really a pleasure to use, be it on a laptop or desktop. Their MacBook Pro line prior to *touchbargate* had pretty great specs and a PCIe solid state drive, and those things fly. Unfortunately, they've lately pivoted their focus as a company to iOS devices and appear to be neglecting Macs. The Mac Pro is in desperate need of some modernization, and would actually be better suited as a rackmount server. Apple is dead set on locking down their hardware; they really don't want you changing stuff out in there. And part of that is making a well-designed product, and space efficiency in design has always been a priotity for Apple. So I get it. The Mac Mini has a lot of potential as a cool little mini desktop box; it just looks a little dated, and use some modern components. The MacBook Pro line did receive a recent refresh, met with lukewarm response. Here's my main issue with it: **cost**. 

### The Price of Apple

Apple is known to be expensive to buy from. And the way I've always framed that is that you get what you pay for, and that goes for almost anything. And it can be worth it - to a degree. Unfortunately, for the MacBook line, it just isn't. And speaking for myself, a potential prospective computer buyer, I'd prefer to look to alternatives to get the most for my dollar as well as peace of mind. Linux fits in well here. Anyway, the cheapest MacBook Pro you can get right now is **$1,499**. And here's what that gets you:

| Spec | Detail | 
|:--------:|:-------:|
| CPU   | 2.0GHz dual core i5   |
| RAM   | 8GB  |
|----
| SSD   | 256GB PCIe   |
| OS   | macOS   |

That, to me, doesn't really stack up compared to the price of parts. I think there's a pretty hefty Apple tax in effect; that model doesn't even include the TouchBar. I'd like to highlight a Dell Precision I configured pretty quick.

| Spec | Detail | 
|:--------:|:-------:|
| CPU   | 2.7GHz quad core i7   |
| RAM   | 16GB  |
|----
| SSD   | 512GB PCIe   |
| OS   | Ubuntu 14.04 LTS   |

Pretty nice, right? The price for that, as configured, is **$1,511**. Approximately the same price as the previously mentioned MBP but with some pretty serious upgrades. Twice as much RAM, storage doubled, and a quad core processor. Dell is doing a really cool thing where they'll *subtract* the cost of Windows if you order a computer with Ubuntu installed. *That is pretty cool.* And it's only fair; Windows charges for a license. Ubuntu probably isn't what I'd leave on there - I'm more of a Fedora guy - but the sentiment is pretty awesome. 

The priciest MacBook Pro lists for **$1,999**. Imagine what kind of Dell *that* could buy.

## Linux

Speaking of Linux, it seems like every other day I see posts on Hacker News of peoples' stories; stories of how they "left" Mac and switched to Linux. Which, while the sentiment could be a thinly veiled jab at Apple and their questionable product line choices, is a good thing. Linux shouldn't be intimidating to use. It's arguably the most simple to use, and the most user friendly once you take to it's layout. It gives you a feeling of ownership; as if you've fought through trials to make it work. And some people don't want to work for their computer, and that's fine, but a lot of people find enjoyment in that process. But that experience is almost guaranteed when using Linux.

### The Benefits of Linux

Open source software is a term that I see used often, but not usually defined well. Maybe it's being communicated more clearly now - but it took me years to really understand what open source software was and why it was called that. It is also referred to as "free" software, but it's a different kind of free. It's free for you to take and do what you want to with it. It's transparent and open to the community and can be improved by a vast, evergrowing group of people. Its freedom enables clarity. Many of the people writing open code are doing so out of love. It's awesome. I have a hard time trusting Microsoft with their privacy policies lately. They are pretty shameless. Apple has always been an advocate for privacy, even if they charge a premium on their products. Linux is truly a labor of love.

## Is it worth it?

For many people, probably not. Linux is kind of a pain sometimes and can result in some pretty exasperating moments. But, for others, switching operating systems is seriously an option. I'd recommend [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/), but Ubuntu, Mint, and Arch all seem to get good marks as well. I think FOSS could have a big impact on the landscape of software; moreso than it already has.
