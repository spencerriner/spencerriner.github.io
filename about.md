I'm Spencer Riner and I do IT work for the Engineering and Robotics branch at Johnson Space Center. I focus on configuration management using Puppet and Linux system administration.

I also make music and promote it shamelessly. Fredman Fredd is on [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/fredmanfredd) and [BandCamp](https://fredmanfredd.bandcamp.com).
