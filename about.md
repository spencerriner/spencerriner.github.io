By day, I'm a System and Network Administrator at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. The spectrum of what I do is pretty wide, but in general I like tinkering with Linux, hacking hardware for personal enjoyment, and refreshing the Hacker News front page a few times an hour. I also record music; you can find some of my recordings on [BandCamp](http://fredmanfredd.bandcamp.com) and [SoundCloud](http://soundcloud.com/fredmanfredd).
