I have this terrible habit, when I record music. I'm trying to break it, but I also needed a plan to facilitate better habits. What usually happens is I sit down at my computer without any ideas, load up a Drummer track, fiddle around on guitar for a bit, come up with something half cool and track it right away. I'll write a few more parts, or a bassline, or whatever, until the skeleton of a song starts to appear. At about this time, I start adding a zillion plugins to all of the existing tracks.

# How Plugins Can Hinder

Logic comes with a bunch of really nice stock plugins, and I've also bought a few along the way when sales come along. I read a lot of articles about compression, EQ, reverb, and how all of those elements can enhance your mix. Yeah, I mean I guess that's pretty obvious, but they don't tell you when you should start applying that stuff. 

The obvious point is that once you have exited from a songwriter/musician/recording mentality and entered an audio engineer/producer/mixer mentality, it becomes really difficult to continue writing songs. Partially because every subsequent part that you record sounds like it doesn't fit. Panning can introduce phase issues and distract you while tracking, and the option of adding or changing an element of the mix just sits in the back of your mind, tempting you.

Of course, should I be writing songs on the fly? Well, probably not. I know that some of my favorite recordings I've done have been born of fully written, complete, songs. Meaning, I'm not recording 5 different instruments for a verse, and then sitting to think of a chorus after they're all done. Because what usually ends up happening is I write a verse, get it sounding really good and produced (and compressed and in a nice reverb space, and with a touch of echo...), stop working for the day and never ever revisit. Partly because the momentum of the moment is no longer present the next day, and partly because I can never remember what kind of settings/levels I used when tracking originally. Which pretty much ruins the song.

Anyway that's the problem. It's got two parts, really, the plugin part and the writing part, but I have a mental model of how to fix it.

# The New Plan

## Write the Song First

This is my biggest hurdle and challenge and I think this alone could really change my lazy, incomplete workflow. On recommendation of a friend, I bought and read a book called The Frustrated Songwriter's Handbook. Spoiler alert, there's one big point and it's this - try and write 20 songs in 12 hours. And stuff like February Album Writing Month kind of facilitates the same mentality, where the pressure of meeting a (sort of unrealistic) deadline makes you less critical.

And after some introspection, I've realized that I'm almost in every case paralyzed by the fear of writing a song that sucks. And if I never finish a song, then it can never suck. I can't really remember the last time I finished a song. So the point of those exercises is to just write, even if you know it sucks, and finish it, so you can move on to the next one. If you do it on a single day in 12 hours and burst out 20 songs, that's great, and if you write one song every two days in February and have 14 songs at the end of the month, that's great too. The goal is to write, even if it sucks. And that's a big roadblock, I know it is for me, and I know it is for a lot of people who also try and do it all - write, perform, record, produce, release, and promote their own original music. 

I do realize that this post is titled "Logic Pro X Minimalist Workflow" and I haven't once talked about any DAW interaction, but I think this kind of mentality shift is an important start to the process. Of course, if you want to write songs on the fly and let the music flow as it happens, that's perfectly fine. I don't think there's a single "correct" way of making music. But based on my own experience and how the last couple of years have been while making music, this is the best first step.

Anyway. My goal for this step is to be able to play through the entire song on an acoustic guitar before even approaching the DAW. 

## Arrange your Workspace

Bet you thought this was about setting up your session and templates and stuff? That's another step but I'm not there yet. After trying to play music in a cluttered, messy, generally unpleasant room, I realized my physical space was affecting my mental clarity. Two books mention the power of arranging your physical space in a way that is pleasant - "The War of Art" and "The Life Changing Magic of Tidying Up." Both of these books provided a lot of clarity into my own creative process. After cleaning my room, and taking the time to put things where they belong, and making it a space that I actually *want* to spend time in, I noticed that I enjoyed playing a lot more. It's a huge factor that nobody ever talks about when people say that they're in a creative rut. Clean your room!

## Make a Template

Finally. Let's talk about Logic. Logic makes it pretty easy for you to quickly jump in and start recording. Make a new project and lay out the skeleton of your tracks. For me, that looks like this:

* MIDI - Superior Drummer
* Audio - Bass
* Audio - Rhythm Guitar (Dynamic)
* Audio - Rhythm Guitar (Condenser)
* Audio - Lead Guitar (Dynamic)
* Audio - Lead Guitar (Condenser)
* Audio - Vocal 1
* Audio - Vocal 2
* Audio - Vocal 3
* MIDI - Electric Piano
* MIDI - Mellotron

Superior Drummer is a pretty great MIDI drum sampler that I've grown to really like. If I'm punching my own drums in, and I usually do, this is my go-to. If I'm feeling lazy or uninspired, I'll go for a Logic Drummer track instead. The electric piano and mellotron sounds in Logic are so cool, and I'll usually add a part or two to fill in space.

I've been doing this new thing since I got my Princeton where I record two mikes at the same time. I put an SM57 up close to the grille, almost touching, and some AKG condenser a bit farther out to kind of get the sound of the room (even if the room isn't that great). Another cool tip I picked up from a buddy, you can later blend these tracks as needed and accentuate whichever track fits the part better. I make a track for each mike for two different guitar parts. Go ahead and set the inputs on these tracks as well and try to keep it consistent between projects. 

## Record Dry

I know for a lot of people this can be challenging, it sucks for me too, but I think it's a good way to do things. Program in the drums for the entire song. This should be pretty easy since we already wrote the entire song...right? Then grab the bass, dial in the settings perfectly, and run through the entire thing in one take. I try not to punch in too much, I really prefer just finishing the entire take and then doing one or two additional takes on top and comping the best parts. 

This works well for me because I don't have to keep switching contexts. I hate plugging and unplugging cables, and I end up doing it a lot because I have a puny two input interface. (To do: buy an interface with more inputs). 

## Take a Break

After plunking down all of these tracks, I'm now free to step away from the desk. My duties as a musician tracking in the studio are officially complete at this point. And I can come back to the track, in an hour, a day, or a week, with a clear head and a blank slate. 

# Work a Lot

At the end of the day, I think as a creator, you just have to put in the work. And you don't have to be in a hurry, but you have to do it. My commitment to myself in the last couple of weeks has been to play guitar for an hour after I get home from work. Does it kind of suck sometimes? Well yeah. Do I not want to do it? Usually. It's really tempting to just grab a snack and plop down on the couch. But I've seen noticeable results since this new thing (I manage to play for at least an hour a day about 5/7 days of the week). My playing is more fluid, and the ideas are quicker to come.

I might try out the 12 hour 20 song challenge sometime, who knows. But I think having a well defined workflow will be a helpful asset however the songs may come.
